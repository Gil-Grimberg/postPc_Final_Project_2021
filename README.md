working with git:

when you're starting to work on a new feature:
1. make sure that your local main branch is update. open a new branch from the main branch, 
   let's call the branch 'A'
2. during your work, if you want to have changes from the remote main branch, perform a commit and
   then pull from main.
3. when you're done working on the feature and you want your changes to exist in the main branch,
   perform commit, then pull from main, and then push your changes to your'e *remote* branch.
   then, go to git, and create a pull request - from your remote branch, to the remote main branch.
   then, the rest of the group will need to review the pull request and approve it. once it's approved,
   click on the 'merge' button in the pull request - now your changes are in the remote main branch.
